			Team <strong>AlgoDex's</strong> primary goal is to develop a 
			<em>robust and useful product</em> that software engineers and 
			programming enthusiasts <em>love to use</em>. <strong>AlgoDex</strong>
			is meant to help engineers by storing algorithms and chunks of code for
			later use. Here at <strong>AlgoDex</strong>, we believe that making this 
			process as efficient as possible for the user means that we can 
			signicantly reduce development time in almost any situation. 
			Other goals include the development of clean code and the development 
			of code that is secure.
		</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 40px">
			Team <strong>AlgoDex's</strong> culture is unique. Both members are veterans with
			beards. While being a veteran is not necessary to join team 
			<strong>AlgoDex</strong>, <u>having a beard as an absolute must</u>. Our
			team is quite laid-back but we also pride ourselves on developing well-written
			code. In short, <em> we take pride in our work</em>.
